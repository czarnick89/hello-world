Whispers in Bloom

In morning's hush, where soft winds play,
The flowers wake to greet the day.
Their petals stretch in golden light,
A tapestry of pure delight.

The rose, in velvet robes so red,
Tells secrets lovers never said.
The daisy beams with open face,
A simple charm, a quiet grace.

Beneath the trees, the bluebells ring
Like tiny chimes in early spring.
While tulips dance in colored rows,
Their laughter carried where breeze blows.

Each blossom sings a fleeting song,
A season’s joy, not meant for long.
Yet in their bloom, they gently show
The beauty found in letting go.

So pause and breathe the petal air,
Their silent kindness everywhere—
For flowers teach, without a word,
What hearts have known, and rarely heard.
